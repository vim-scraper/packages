" Last Update: Jul 16 2001
" Version: 1.1
" 
" sourceSafe.vim - A simple script that interfaces with the MS VSS command
" line.  This script works on the current file opened and is meant to only
" perform frequently used tasks such as checkin, checkout, get current file,
" check differences and so on.  The current lock status can also be displayed
" in the vim window; examples of placing it in the ruler are provided below.
" 
" Setup: Two settings under the "CONFIGURATION" section below must first be
" customized for your environment.  The third setting (rulerformat) is optional.
"
" Usage: See the "COMMANDS" section below for how to use this script.  
"
" Updates:
" 1.1 - The current lock status is now available from the VSSGetStatus()
"       function.  It looks really good in the ruler!  Samples are provided
"       below.  Also see :help rulerformat.
"     - Command responses are now echo'ed to the screen.
"     - Added silent flag (Daniel Einspanjer)
" 1.0 - Initial release

" Todo:
"  - Take advantage of the built-in diff util!  ...Although VSS's "View" command
"    doesn't obey the -O switch... suggestions anyone on how to get around
"    this?
"
" Please send me any improvements you make so they can be included!

" --- CONFIGURATION ---

" Change this environment variable to the path of your VSS database.  The path to your
" database can be found in VSS under File->Open SourceSafe Database.
let $SSDIR="//gamma/swdev/src/jrave"


" Files are referenced in VSS like this:
"
" $/the/path/to/your/file
"
" So in order to match the path of the local file to the format above, the top-level
" directory must be changed to "$".
" For example, if the current file is
"
"   C:/dev/project/main.c
"
" then to check the status of the currently opened file the following VSS
" command would need to be sent
"
"   ss Status $/project/main.c
"
" The following substitue pattern will change to "$" for these commands, so
" change this setting to the top level of your local tree.
" let vssTree="C:\\\\dev"
"  or simply:
" let vssTree="C:.dev"
" 
" This also works well:
let vssTree=".*dev[0-9.]*"
" 
" NOTE: These do not work:
" let vssTree="C:\dev"
" let vssTree="C:\\dev"
" let vssTree="C:/dev"


" The current lock status is available from the VSSGetStatus() command.  A
" really good place to put this info is in the ruler, like so: 
"
" set rulerformat=%{VSSGetStatus()}
"
" The current lock status is updated when the file opens and after every :SS
" command (see COMMANDS section below)
"
" The following works well; change it to your liking.
set rulerformat=%60(%=%{VSSGetStatus()}%)\ %5l,%-4c\ %3p%%
