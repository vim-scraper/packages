" File: foldlist.vim
" Author: Paul C. Wei
" Version: l.0.4
" Last Modified: 11/28/2002
"
" Overview
" --------
" This is inspired by the taglist plugin.  The "Fold List" plugin 
" provides the following features:
"
" 1. Opens a vertically split Vim window with a list of folds in 
"    the current file. Uses the fold name as a search pattern to
"    goto the fold.
" 2. Moving through the fold list with the j, k, l, h, moves to the
"    associated fold in the file.
" 3. <CR> jumps to associated fold in file.
"
" Installation
" ------------
" 1. Copy the foldlist.vim script to the $HOME/.vim/plugin directory.  Refer to
"    ':help add-plugin', ':help add-global-plugin' and ':help runtimepath' for
"    more details about Vim plugins.
" 2. Restart Vim.
" 3. You can use the ":Flist" command to open the foldlist window. 
" 4. Handle up to 9 levels of folds. (search for '__T9' to change)
"
" Usage
" -----
" You can open the foldinst window from a source window by using the ":Flist"
" command.
"               nnoremap <silent> <F9> :Flist<CR>
"
" Add the above mapping to your ~/.vimrc file.
"
" You can close the taglist window from the taglist window by pressing 'q' or
" using the Vim ":q" command. 
"
" Send comments/suggestions/fixes to pwei@san.rr.com.
"
" Caveats:
" ---------
" 1. Fold is searched using fold title only. This may find other places in file
"    with the same string. I currently just hit 'l' or 'h' till find the
"    correct fold. Will fix by adding a tag if it becomes sufficiently annoying.
"
" Wish List
" ---------
" 1. Make fold list hierarchical & folding.
" 2. Make compatible w/ hi-note on palm (prob through ext conversion prog).
" 3. Allow for changes in fold hierarchy in fold list reflect in file
"
" Example:
" --------
" /* vim: set fdm=marker : */
" Phones {{{
" }}}
" ToDo {{{
" Work {{{
" }}}
" Shop {{{
" }}}
" }}}
"
" Generates:
" Phones
" ToDo
"  Work
"  Shop
