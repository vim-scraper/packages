" \brief	This provides a function that you can call in your header file
"			(with cursor on the function to be placed into your souce file) and
"			then called from your source file where you want the function
"			definition to be placed and the function makes it all pretty and
"			does most of the work for you. Pretty handy.

" Version:	0.43
" History: {{{
"	[Feral:290/02@06:15] 0.43
"		Bugfix, The case of filename extension no loger matters during the
"		check for header/source.
"	[Feral:288/02@08:49] 0.42
"		namespaces and destructors now are handled properly.
"	Improvments:
"		* properly handles namespaces, thanks to Russell for pointing this
"			out.
"		* Proprly handles class destructors, Thanks to Andy for pointing this
"			out.
"	[Feral:287/02@00:32] 0.41
"		Drat.
"	Improvments:
"		* Fixed a fold marker bungle (had a mismated closing foldmarker at the
"			end of this comment block. erm, oops.)
"		* Bugfix: Using setlocal now. (as a ftplugin should)
"		* More Cleanup.
"		* Can be invoked in the middle of a multi line function decloration
"			now, much better.
"		* Now uses global vars to decide what commands to define, defaulting
"			to :GHPH. See ||@|GHPH Options| below
"	Limitations:
"		* (recap) A inlined function with no (); construct will not be
"			recognised as a function.
"	[Feral:286/02@16:58] 0.4
"		Thanks to Andy for pointing out that inlined functions caused this to
"		fail.
"	Improvments:
"		* Changed method to find the class, now works with inlined functions.
"		* Added :GH and :PH remed, unrem if you want to use them.
"		* General Script Cleanup (I hope!)
"		* Replaced function params with global vars for options; allows
"			onthefly option changing.
""
"			(I hope you consider it an improvement anyway (: if you do not you
"			can basicaly ignore this fancy smacy global var stuff by unremming
"			the :lets at the command definition below and then forgetting them
"			:) )
"	Limitations:
"		* A inlined function with no (); construct will not be recognised as a
"			function.
"		* (recap) Must be invoked on the line that starts the the function
"			decloration. -- I'll probably get around to doing something with
"			this limitation eventually.
"	[Feral:283/02@16:42] 0.33
"		Thanks again goto Rostislav for ideas and suggestions
"	Improvments:
"		* Proper FTPlugin now, at least I think.
"		* struct and nested structs workie now too.
"		* can specify an override param and have :GHPH paste or get
"			regardless of the file type it's in. i.e. :GHPH p or :GHPH g
"		* added .hpp, .hh, .hxx as recognizable header files.
"	[Feral:282/02@17:03] 0.32
"		Rather large change to support nested classes. Ok not THAT large.
"		Thanks to Rostislav for pointing this out.
"		Using searchpair to find the class inspired by Luc Hermitte.
"	Improvments:
"		* More intelligent/robust checking/finding the class.
"		* Nested classes are now supported.
"		* Normal functions now work.
"	[Feral:281/02@16:24] 0.31
"		as Rostislav Julinek pointed out [[ does not work when the brace is not
"			in col 1. If you like your braces after your class definition this
"			should do the trick for you.
"	[Feral:278/02@00:29] 0.3
"	Improvments:
"		* fairly drastic improvement. Now works with multi-line function
"			declarations as long as they are properly closed(open prens will
"			make this fail), aka if it compiles it should work.
"	Limitation:
"		* Must be invoked on the line that starts the the function decloration.
"	[Feral:275/02@14:50] 0.21
"		* Itty bitty file format changes, email address is Rot13ed now,
"			documtation and command defintions are folded.
"		* Slight improvement(?) in fetching the line, in a script so why not
"			getline(".") eh?
"	[Feral:274/02@20:42] 0.2
"	Improvments: from Leif's Tip (#335):
"		* can handle any number of default prams (as long as they are all on
"			the same line!)
"		* Options on how to format default params, virtual and static. (see
"			below) TextLink:||@|Prototype:|
"		* placed commands into a function (at least I think it's an improvement
"			;) )
"		* Improved clarity of the code, at least I hope.
"		* Preserves registers/marks. (rather does not use marks), Should not
"			dirty anything.
"		* All normal operations do not use mappings i.e. :normal!
"			(I have Y mapped to y$ so Leif's mappings could fail for me.)
"
"	Limitations:
"		* fails on multi line declorations. All prams must be on the same line.
"		* fails for non member functions. (though not horibly, just have to
"			remove the IncorectClass:: text...
"	0.1

" }}}
" Ideas Thoughts And Possible Expansions: {{{ Feedback requested.
"	Should This Also Manage Data Members:? {{{2
"		(basicaly mearge what I did with getset.vim into this.)
"		Advantages:
"		* No need to remember another command (of course one could easily make
"			a stub that calls this or getset (for instance) based on the
"			contents of the lne.
"
"			Or stub this to call getset if the line does not register as a
"				function decloration, which is probably what I'll end up doing
"				if no one cares... [Feral:286/02@17:53]
"		Disadvantages:
"		* Would clutter up the code and if you already have a getset type
"			thing (Luc has a very nice one) it's pointless wasted space.
"			(Unless it is just I just call another func when I think it's a
"			member var.)

"	Handel Template Functions: {{{2
"		Ideas from Rostislav and Luc
"		What do these things look like anyway? -- I have not messed with
"			templates enough to know the ins and outs of them, examples wanted!
