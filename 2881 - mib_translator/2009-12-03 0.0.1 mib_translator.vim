" CHANGELOG:
"   0.0.1, 2009-12-04
"     - First version with forward and reverse OID translation.
"
" INSTALLATION:
"   - Drop the script into your plugin directory.
"   - The name of the plugin starts with the string 'mib', which
"     means it can be used with files with '.mib' extension if the
"     plugin is placed in the ftplugin directory.
"     But, most of the MIB files have the extension of '.txt',
"     and some have the extension '.my'.
"     Also, it can be used from anywhere since it has actually
"     nothing to do with the file extension, so it is better to
"     place it in the plugin directory instead of ftplugin.
"
" COMMANDS:
"   :OidReverseTranslate <oidName>
"     Displays the OID information if the OID name is given.
"     This is the reverse translation.
"     :OidReverseTranslate ipv6MIB
"   :OidTranslate <oidNumber>
"     Displays the OID information if the OID number is given.
"     This is the forward translation.
"     :OidTranslate .1.3.6.1.2.1.55
"
" USAGE:
"   You can use the plugin as the COMMANDS section shows.
"   Note that you do not have to open a MIB file to use this plugin.
"   It will work anyway, but if you open a MIB file, you can use as:
"     1. Get the cursor to a OID name, for example ipv6MIB.
"     2. Type : to get to command mode.
"     3. Type OidReverseTranslate
"     4. Type <space>
"     5. Type <C-r> <C-w>
"     6. Press <enter>
"
"
" CONFIGURATION:
"   The options are:
"
"   g:OidTranslatorBufferName:
"     The name of the MIB translator buffer.
"     The tranlated values will be displayed here.
"     There is no need to change this if there are no clash
"     with another plugin.
"     Default is 'OIDTranslator'.
"
"   g:OidTranslatorBufferSize:
"     The size of the buffer. It is the line count. If your
"     screen is small, you can reduce the this size, or if
"     your screen is huge, you can raise this number.
"     Default is 10.
"
"   g:SnmpTranslatePath:
"     The executable path of the snmptranslate command of Net-SNMP.
"     If the bin folder is in your path, no need to change this setting.
"     If it is not, set this option from your VIMRC.
"     The value must the path to the executable, not the directory
"     including the executable.
"     For example, a valid value is:
"     let g:SnmpTranslatePath = 'C:\\usr\\bin\\snmptranslate.exe'
"     The default value is 'snmptranslate', so that it can
"     directly run without modification if snmptranslate is included
"     in a directory on path.
"     Note that if Net-SNMP is not on the path, even though you
"     define this option correct, snmptranslate itself can have
"     difficulties to find the MIB files, so it is recommended
"     to keep it on the path and not changing this option.
"
" REQUIREMENTS:
"   - Net-SNMP package must be installed on your system.
"     http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/
"     It is also strongly recommended to add 'C:\usr\bin' to the
"     path in Windows.
