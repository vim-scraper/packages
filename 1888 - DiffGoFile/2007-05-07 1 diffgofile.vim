" Functions FindOrCreateBuffer and EqualFilePaths were takend from a.vim 2.16,
" http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=31. Thank you :)

" Description:
" If you are editing diff file and you want to jump quickly to corresponding
" source files, function DiffGoFile does that. Place cursor on the spot in diff
" file which interests you, call DiffGoFile and you will be presented with the
" source file exactly at the place you were looking at. Currently only unified
" diff is supported, but the script has framework for adding more types.

" Installation:
" Copy script to your plugins directory

" Configuration:
" You may wish to setup a hotkey, I'm using CTRL-] (:tag) for example
"
" autocmd FileType diff nnoremap <buffer> <C-]> :call DiffGoFile()<CR>

" Possible TODOs:
" * Support other diff types (normal, context)
"   see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff
"   - to add new diff type, copy ParseUnified function to new one, and update
"     s:parse_engines list at the end of this file
"
