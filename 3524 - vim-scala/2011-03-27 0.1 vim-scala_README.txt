The plugin is at https://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-scala.  Either go there and
click "Download" or use 'git' to get it as you normally would with 'git'.
Please enhance / fix if you can.

You should be using 'pathogen' to manage you Vim plugins; if you're not, put
that in first :)  Then copy 'vim-scala' to ~/.vim/bundle and restart Vim.
