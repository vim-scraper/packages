"color_toon.vim -- colorscheme toy
" Maintainer:   Walter Hutchins
" Last Change:  Friday, July 07 2006
" Version:      1.3.01
" Setup:        Copy color_toon.vim to ~/.vim/plugin/
"
"               Windows - copy to $VIMRUNTIME/plugin
"                       - adjust myjunk | adjust plugin location if necessary.
"
" Thanks to: colortest
" Thanks to: Tip #634: To view all colours 
" Thanks to: hitest.vim
"Use without any expectations.
"Please liberally use :qa! and :q! whenever you like.
"
"Usage: Colortoon
"       Colortoon -d[ark] -j[unk]
"       call Color_toon()
"       
"       Colortoon -d  Does dark colors first (see < 7 Oops:)
"       Colortoon -j  Input syntax from myjunk.vim file
"       
"       Defaults are to start with light colors and to not use myjunk colors.
"       This was changed in version 1.3 from default of using myjunk.
"
" Usage: (1) First, run Colortoon.
"        (2) Position to desired hi group in myjunk window and type :y b
"        (3) Position to desired color in light or dark window and type :y a
"        (4) Colormake                 - Set foreground color per registers a,b
"            Colormake -b[ackground]   - Set background color per registers a,b
"
"         In steps 2 & 3, ':y a' means :y<SPACEBAR>a<RETURN>
"                                   or :yank<SPACEBAR>a<RETURN>
"                                   or "ayy
"                         ':y b' means :y<SPACEBAR>b<RETURN>
"                                   or :yank<SPACEBAR>b<RETURN>
"                                   or "byy
"                         
"                        If you consistently(!) reverse a and b, it still works.
"
"Somethings: to do are:
"Scroll up and down in the 'dark' and 'light' windows to see what the
"cterm and gui numbers are for the colors.
"Scroll up and down in the 'myjunk.vim' window to see highlighting groups.
"Go into myjunk window and :w! to save current colors in myjunk.vim.
"
"If you happen to get a color scheme, copy 'myjunk.vim' to 'myugly.vim'
"or whatever. Then stick 'let colors_name="myugly"' in myugly.vim.
"If myjunk.vim gets to where you don't like it anymore, then delete it
"and it will be created from your default colorscheme (maybe).
"
"Customize a gui color. Only works for six-digit-hex color numbers.
" (1) Position to the color nearest to your desired color in the light or dark 
" (2) window and type :y a
" (3) type :new
" (4) type "ap
" (5) edit the gui_xxxxxx 
" (6) type :y a
" (7) type :q!
" (8) type :Colormake   or  :Colormake -b
" (9) Go into the myjunk window and type :w! (only if you like it.)
" Note: The custom color won't 'stick' if you later change that hi group.
"
"Manually edit a hi group and manually "refresh" the highlighting.
" (1) Edit the hi group line in the myjunk window.
" (2) On that line, in normal mode, type 0v$y
" (3) Type :@"<ENTER>
"
"Translate a supported color from gui to cterm or cterm to gui to make
" it work the same in both gui and xterm.
"
"Get assistance with selecting a color from the colorsel.vim script
" at www.vim.org
"
" Note: If you use set guifont= in a vim setting, there could be a resulting
"       font= part in one of the hi groups and you should edit it out
"       to be friendly to xterms.
"
"Oops: vim < 7 can't help it:
"Vim < 7, when you start up Colortoon, there will be an error -- too many 
"highlighting groups while it is trying to show the colors in the 
"light and dark windows.  It stumbles after around 200th one encountered. 
"If you need to see the rest of dark ones, say 'Colortoon -dark'. 
"May need to completely get out of all windows before it will show 
"different ones (this is a funny thing.)
"
"Remember to use :qa! and :q! whenever you like -- to bail out.
