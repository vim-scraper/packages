" Function : AlternateFile (PUBLIC)
" Purpose  : Opens a new buffer by looking at the extension of the current
"            buffer and finding the corresponding file. E.g. foo.c <--> foo.h
" Args     : accepts one argument. If present it used the argument as the new
"            extension.
" Returns  : nothing
