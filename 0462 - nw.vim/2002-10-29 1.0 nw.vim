" NOWEB is a collection of tools for "Literate Programming". 
" Unlike WEB or CWEB it is not bound to a specific programming
" language like PASCAL or C.
" For more informations about NOWEB, the sources or binary distributions

" Like in CWEB, a NOWEB source file is treated as a TeX file
" including code chunks in between.
source <sfile>:p:h/tex.vim

" The reference to a chunk of code in another code chunk.
syntax match nowebCodeRef contained /<<.>>\|<<[^ ].*[^ ]>>/

" The code text within a code chunk.
syntax region nowebCodeBody contained start=/>>=.\|>>=$/lc=3 end=/^@ \|^@$/me=e-3 contains=nowebCodeRef

" NOWEB code chunks are defined by <<chunk_name>>=
" and ended by the next "@" (not a "@@"!) in the first column of a line.
syntax region nowebCode start=/<<.>>=\|<<[^ ].*[^ ]>>=/ end=/^@ \|^@$/me=e-3 contains=nowebCodeBody

" Here, we mark the beginning of a new text chunk.
syntax match nowebStartText /^@ \|^@$/
