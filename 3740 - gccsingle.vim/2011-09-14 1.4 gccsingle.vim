"           It has follow features:
"               1. Use gcc compiler.
"               2. Compile and run single c source file just one command.
"               3. Program's output is showing below the source file in a new window.
"               4. You can hide the output window easily.
"               5. When there are some errors, quick window will automatically appears.
"               6. When there is no error, quick window hides automatically and the program is running.
"               7. When you compile it, source code is saved by the script, so you need not to save it.
"               8. Only three commands, easily to remember, easily to use.
"
"           The most cool things are:

"                2. Quick window shows and hides automatically.
"                3. Everything happened in vim, no ugly command window.
