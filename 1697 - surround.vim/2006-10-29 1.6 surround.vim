" *surround.txt*  Plugin for deleting, changing, and adding "surroundings"

"
" Introduction:                                   *surround*
"
" This plugin is a tool for dealing with pairs of "surroundings."  Examples
" of surroundings include parentheses, quotes, and HTML tags.  They are
" closely related to what Vim refers to as |text-objects|.  Provided
" are mappings to allow for removing, changing, and adding surroundings.
"
" Details follow on the exact semantics, but first, consider the following
" examples.  An asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor position.
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"   "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
"   [123+4*56]/2              cs])        (123+456)/2
"   "Look ma, I'm *HTML!"     cs"<q>      <q>Look ma, I'm HTML!</q>
"   if *x>3 {                 ysW(        if ( x>3 ) {
"   my $str = *whee!;         vlllls'     my $str = 'whee!';
"
" While a few features of this plugin will work in older versions of Vim,
" Vim 7 is recommended for full functionality.
"
" Mappings:                                       *surround-mappings*
"
" Delete surroundings is *ds*.  The next character given determines the target
" to delete.  The exact nature of the target are explained in
" |surround-targets| but essentially it is the last character of a
" |text-object|.  This mapping deletes the difference between the "inner"
" object and "an" object.  This is easiest to understand with some examples:
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"   "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
"   (123+4*56)/2              ds)         123+456/2
"   <div>Yo!*</div>           dst         Yo!
"
" Change surroundings is *cs*.  It takes two arguments, a target like with
" |ds|, and a replacement.  Details about the second argument can be found
" below in |surround-replacements|.  Once again, examples are in order.
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"   "Hello *world!"           cs"'        'Hello world!'
"   "Hello *world!"           cs"<q>      <q>Hello world!</q>
"   (123+4*56)/2              cs)]        [123+456]/2
"   (123+4*56)/2              cs)[        [ 123+456 ]/2
"   <div>Yo!*</div>           cst<p>      <p>Yo!</p>
"
" *ys* takes an valid Vim motion or text object as the first object, and wraps
" it using the second argument as with |cs|.  (Unfortunately there's no good
" mnemonic for "ys").
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"   Hello w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!
"
" As a special case, *yss* operates on the current line, ignoring leading
" whitespace.
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"       Hello w*orld!         yssB            {Hello world!}
"
" In visual mode, a simple "s" with an argument wraps the selection.  This is
" referred to as the *vs* mapping, although ordinarily there will be
" additional keystrokes between the v and s.  Note that "s" already has a
" valid meaning in visual mode, but it is identical to "c".  If you have
" muscle memory for "s" and would like to use a different key, add your own
" mapping and the existing one will be disabled.
" >
"   vmap S <Plug>Vsurround
" <
" Finally, there is an experimental insert mode mapping on <C-S>.  Beware that
" this won't work on terminals with flow control (if you accidentally freeze
" your terminal, use <C-Q> to unfreeze it).  The mapping inserts the specified
" surroundings and puts the cursor between them.  If, immediately after <C-S>
" and before the replacement, carriage return is pressed, the prefix, cursor,
" and suffix will be placed on three separate lines.  If this is a common use
" case you can add a mapping for it as well.

" Targets:                                        *surround-targets*
"
" The |ds| and |cs| commands both take a target as their first argument.  The
" possible targets are based closely on the |text-objects| provided by Vim.
" In order for a target to work, the corresponding text object must be
" supported in the version of Vim used (Vim 7 adds several text objects, and
" thus is highly recommended).  All targets are currently just one character.
"
" Eight punctuation marks, (, ), {, }, [, ], <, and >, represent themselves
" and their counterpart.  If the opening mark is used, contained whitespace is
" also trimmed.  The targets b, B, r, and a are aliases for ), }, ], and >
" (the first two mirror Vim; the second two are completely arbitrary and
" subject to change).
"
" Three quote marks, ', ", `, represent themselves, in pairs.  They are only
" searched for on the current line.
"
" A t is a pair of HTML or XML tags.  See |tag-blocks| for details.
"
" The letters w, W, and s correspond to a |word|, a |WORD|, and a |sentence|,
" respectively.  These are special in that they have nothing do delete, and
" used with |ds| they are a no-op.  With |cs|, one could consider them a
" slight shortcut for ysi (cswb == ysiwb, more or less).
"
" A p represents a |paragraph|.  This behaves similarly to w, W, and s above;
" however, newlines are sometimes added and/or removed.
"
" Replacements:                                   *surround-replacements*
"
" A replacement argument is a single character, and is required by |cs|, |ys|,
" and |vs|.  Undefined replacement characters default to placing themselves at
" the beginning and end of the destination, which can be useful for characters
" like / and |.
"
" If either ), }, ], or > is used, the text is wrapped in the appropriate
" pair of characters.  Similar behavior can be found with (, {, and [ (but not
" <), which append an additional space to the inside.  Like with the targets
" above, b, B, r, and a are aliases for ), }, ], and >.
"
" If t or < is used, Vim prompts for an HTML/XML tag to insert.  You may
" specify attributes here and they will be stripped from the closing tag.
" End your input by pressing <CR> or >.
"
" An experimental replacement of a LaTeX environment is provided on \ and l.
" The name of the environment and any arguments will be input from a prompt.
" Opening and closing delimiters are not automatically placed on lines of
" their own; you must arrange for this to happen.  The following shows the
" resulting environment from csp\tabular}{lc<CR>
" >
"   \begin{tabular}{lc}
"   \end{tabular}
" <
" Customizing:                                    *surround-customizing*
"
" The following adds a potential replacement on "-" (ASCII 45) in PHP files.
" (To determine the ASCII code to use, :echo char2nr("-")).  The newline will
" be replaced by the original text.
" >
"   autocmd FileType php let b:surround_45 = "<?php \n ?>"
" <
" This can be used in a PHP file as in the following example.
"
"   Old text                  Command     New text ~
"   print "Hello *world!"     yss-        <?php print "Hello world!" ?>
"
" Additionally, one can use a global variable for globally available
" replacements.
" >
"   let g:surround_45 = "<% \n %>"
" <
" Issues:                                         *surround-issues*
"
" Vim could potentially get confused when deleting/changing occurs at the very
" end of the line.  Please report any repeatable instances of this.
"
" Do we need to use |inputsave()|/|inputrestore()| with the tag replacement?
"
" Customization isn't very flexible.  Need a system that allows for prompting,
" like with HTML tags and LaTeX environments.
"
" Indenting is handled haphazardly.  Need to decide the most appropriate
" behavior and implement it.  Right now one can do :let b:surround_indent = 1
" (or the global equivalent) to enable automatic re-indenting by Vim via |=|;
" should this be the default?
"
" It would be nice if |.| would work to repeat an operation.
