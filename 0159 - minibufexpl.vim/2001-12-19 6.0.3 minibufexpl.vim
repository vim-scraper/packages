" Name Of File: minibufexpl.vim
"  Description: Mini Buffer Explorer Vim Plugin
"   Maintainer: Bindu Wavell <binduwavell@yahoo.com
"          URL: http://www.wavell.net/vim/plugin/minibufexpl.vim
"  Last Change: Tuesday, December 18, 2001
"      Version: 6.0.3
"               Derived from Jeff Lanzarotta's bufexplorer.vim version 6.0.7
"               Jeff can be reached at (jefflanzarotta@yahoo.com) and the
"               original plugin can be found at:
"               http://lanzarotta.tripod.com/vim/plugin/6/bufexplorer.vim.zip
"
"        Usage: Normally, this file should reside in the plugins
"               directory and be automatically sourced. If not, you must
"               manually source this file using ':source minibufexplorer.vim'.
"
"               You may use the default keymappings of
"
"                 <Leader>mbe - Opens MiniBufExplorer
"
"               or you may want to add something like the following
"               key mapping to your _vimrc/.vimrc file.
"
"                 map <Leader>b :MiniBufExplorer<cr>
"
"               However, in most cases you won't need any key-bindings at all.
"
"               To control where the new split window goes relative to
"               the current window, use the variable:"
"
"                 let g:miniBufExplSplitBelow=0  " Put new window above
"                                                " current.
"                 let g:miniBufExplSplitBelow=1  " Put new window below
"                                                " current.
"
"               The default for this is read from the &splitbellow vim option.
"
"               By default we are now (as of 6.0.2) forcing the -MiniBufExplorer-
"               window to open up at the edge of the screen. You can turn this 
"               off by setting the following variable:
"
"               By default we are now (as of 6.0.1) turning on the MoreThanOne
"               option. This stops the -MiniBufExplorer- from opening 
"               automatically until more than one eligible buffer is available.
"               You can turn this feature off by setting the following variable:
"                 
"                 let g:miniBufExplorerMoreThanOne=0
"
"                 let g:miniBufExplSplitToEdge=0
"
"      History: 6.0.3 Changed buffer name to -MiniBufExplorer- to resolve
"                     Issue in filename pattern matching on Windows.
"               6.0.2 2 Changes requested by Suresh Govindachar
"                     Added SplitToEdge option and set it on by default
"                     Added tab and shift-tab mappings in [MBE] window
"               6.0.1 Added MoreThanOne option and set it on by default
"                     MiniBufExplorer will not automatically open until
"                     more than one eligible buffers are opened. This
"                     reduces cluter when you are only working on a
"                     single file.
"               6.0.0 Initial Release on November 20, 2001
