" TabManager.vim: a plugin to rearrange open buffers across multiple tabs in Vim.
" By: Salman Halim
" Version 1.1
" Date: Saturday, April 02, 2011
"
" Sorts and rearranges all open buffers across tabs based on built-in or user-specified criteria.
"
" Configuration: The variable g:TabManager_maxFilesInTab (defaults to 5) is used to determine how many buffers to open in each tab.
"
" General usage:
"
" All of these commands optionally take a number which determines how many buffers to open per tab (new tabs get created as necessary); 0 means to lump all
" buffers of any given typeinto one tab.
"
" For the following examples, assume these buffers are open (doesn't matter how many tabs they currently take):
"
" /progs/com/test/Abcd.java
" /progs/com/test/ProgramRunner.java
" /progs/com/abc/Test.java
" /vim/plugin/TabManager.vim
"
" Version 1.1:
"
" Added two new commands:
"
" Rearrangetabsbytype: If it's a Java file, returns the last word that's not a part of the extension. For example, CopyAction.java returns Action and
" CopyForm.java returns Form. This should probably be reworked to allow the setting of the extension upon which to filter or to not look at extensions at all.
"
" Rearrangetabsbyroot: Groups files with similarly named roots together. For example, CopyAction.java, CopyForm.java and CopyResults.jsp will end up together
" because they all have "Copy" as the root.
"
" Version 1.0:
"
" Rearrangetabsbyfirstletter: Quick alphabetization of buffers where all buffers with the same starting letter are put together. Only the file name is
" considered, not the path. So, at the end, you get three tabs:
"
" Tab 1: Abcd.java
" Tab 2: ProgramRunner.java
" Tab 3: TabManager.vim and Test.java
"
" (The tabs are sorted as are the results within each tab.)
"
" Rearrangetabsbyextension: Arranges by extension (.java or .vim, for example):
"
" Tab 1: Abcd.java, ProgramRunner.java and Test.java
" Tab 2: TabManager.vim
"
" Rearrangetabsbypath: Arranges by absolute file path (not taking filename into consideration):
"
" Tab 1: /progs/com/abc: Test.java
" Tab 2: /progs/com/test: Abcd.java and ProgramRunner.java
" Tab 3: /vim/plugin: TabManager.vim
"
" Tiletabs: Quick way to alphabetize the list of buffers (case sensitive) into regularly-sized (by number of buffers) tabs. Doesn't make sense to use this with
" 0 (all buffers in one tab), unless that's the effect you want.
"
" Rearrangetabs: The workhorse. All other other commands are defined through this. Takes the actual pattern criteria against which to match each buffer.
