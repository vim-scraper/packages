" TabManager.vim: a plugin to rearrange open buffers across multiple tabs in Vim.
" By: Salman Halim
"
" Sorts and rearranges all open buffers across tabs based on built-in or user-specified criteria.
"
" Configuration: The variable g:TabManager_maxFilesInTab (defaults to 5) is used to determine how many buffers to open in each tab.
"
" General usage:
"
" All of these commands optionally take a number which determines how many buffers to open per tab (new tabs get created as necessary); 0 means to lump all
" buffers of any given type into one tab.
"
" For the following examples, assume these buffers are open (doesn't matter how many tabs they currently take):
"
" /progs/com/test/Abcd.java
" /progs/com/test/ProgramRunner.java
" /progs/com/abc/Test.java
" /vim/plugin/TabManager.vim
"
" Version 1.7:
"
" No real change; has a dependency upon GetVar which I had forgotten to mention before.
"
" Version 1.6:
"
" Added a new command:
"
" Rearrangetabsbypackage: Works just like Rearrangetabsbypath, except uses the package the files are in. Only useful for files that specify a package in this
" format:
"
" package some.package.name;
"
" (The semicolon is optional.) Files that don't have a package will fall back to the entire file path (no path component specification; the ENTIRE path will be
" considered.)
"
" Takes either one or two arguments:

" Rearrangetabsbypackage [number of files per tab] [number of path components to consider]
" Or
" Rearrangetabsbypackage [number of path components to consider]
"
" Version 1.55:
"
" Rearrangetabsbypath now also takes a second parameter which determines how many components from the path to consider. For example, given the following set of
" files:
"
" /progs/com/test/Abcd.java
" /progs/com/test/ProgramRunner.java
" /progs/com/abc/Test.java
"
" The default behaviour would be to create two tabs, one with Abcd.java and ProgramRunner.java; and the other with Test.java. However, if called with a
" parameter of 2, it will only consider the first two path components (/progs/com) and put all the files in the same tab. A value of 0 (the default) means to
" check the entire path, as before. New command format:
"
" Rearrangetabsbypath [number of files per tab] [number of path components to consider]
" Or
" Rearrangetabsbypath [number of path components to consider]
"
" Version 1.5:
"
" Added the ability to set custom "keys" to be used when rearranging files into tabs. For example, given the following list of files:

" /progs/com/test/Abcd.java
" /progs/com/test/ProgramRunner.java
" /progs/com/abc/Test.java
" /vim/plugin/TabManager.vim
" /webFiles/root/test.html
" /webFiles/root/css/styles.css
"
" The default behaviour, when arranging by path, extension or first letters, is to always place test.html and styles.css in separate tabs. (Unless calling
" Tiletabs, which just tiles all windows blindly.) However, if both these files have a manually set key of, say, "web", then any other criteria will be ignored
" and these two files will always be placed together because they have the same key. This allows grouping some windows by functionality while continuing to
" group others by whatever rearrange command is actually called.
"
" Of course, different sets of windows may have different keys and they will all be grouped together accordingly.
"
" All of the standard Rearrange* commands now take an optional bang (!)--for example, Rearrangetabsbyextension!--that will, for just this rearrangement, IGNORE
" any local keys and treat all windows as if there were no keys.
"
" If you have multiple windows where you're editing the same buffer, they will almost always end up together after any rearrangement (unless they are split
" across tabs that become full). You can avoid this by setting different window-level local keys for the buffers.
"
" Added four new commands--the set and remove key commands can be combined with windo and tabdo to set or remove the same key for more than one window at a time:
"
" Settabmanagerwindowkey <key>: Sets the window-level local key for the current window to <key>.
"
" Settabmanagerbufferkey <key>: Sets the buffer-level local key for the current buffer to <key>.
"
" Removetabmanagerkey: Removes the currently set key for the current window; will remove BOTH buffer and window level keys. (Doesn't take any arguments.)
"
" Redorearrangetabs: Redoes the last tab rearrangement command (by extension, simple tiling, by first letters, etc.). Useful for incorporating new windows into
" the currenty "scheme". If local keys have changed, the layout may end up being different. If new windows have been added, the layout may be different, also,
" but that may be what you want. By default, it obeys local keys (even if the last command was called with a bang and did not). Accepts a bang (!) to ignore
" local keys.
"
" If you call this before you've run any actual rearrangement commands, you will most likely (deservedly) get an error.
"
" Version 1.45:
"
" Added new command:
"
" Copytotab: copies the current file to the specified tab (just like Movetotab except that the original tab also contains the file).
"
" Version 1.4:
"
" Added new command:
"
" Movetotab: moves the current file to the specified tab; understands absolute numbers (1 for the first tab, for example) as well as:
"
" - n: next tab
" - p: previous tab
" - $: last tab
"
" Version 1.35:
"
" Takes 'ignorecase' into consideration for matching extensions, first letters and complete file paths (but not for matching roots and "types").
"
" Version 1.3:
"
" Rearrangetabsbyfirstletter renamed to Rearrangetabsbyfirstletters: If called with no parameters, considers the first character of the file name, as before.
"
" If called with one parameter, the specified number of characters is considered. For example, with no parameters, "Test.java" and "Touring.java" would be
" placed together because both start with a T. With 2 as the parameter value, they would be separated ("Te" vs. "To").
"
" If called with two parameters, the first parameter is the number of windows to place in one tab, as always (0 meaning to throw them all together).
"
" Version 1.2:
"
" New variable: g:TabManager_fileTypeExtension (defaults to "java") to use when determining the Rearrangetabsbytype; can be passed to the command on the
" command-line as an override.
"
" Rearrangetabsbytype now takes an extension (other than the default "java" or g:TabManager_fileTypeExtension) to use when sorting the files. If only one
" parameter is passed, it may be either a number or the extension. If both are specified, the number must be first.
"
" Version 1.1:
"
" Added two new commands:
"
" Rearrangetabsbytype: If it's a Java file, returns the last word that's not a part of the extension. For example, CopyAction.java returns Action and
" CopyForm.java returns Form. This should probably be reworked to allow the setting of the extension upon which to filter or to not look at extensions at all.
"
" Rearrangetabsbyroot: Groups files with similarly named roots together. For example, CopyAction.java, CopyForm.java and CopyResults.jsp will end up together
" because they all have "Copy" as the root.
"
" Version 1.0:
"
" Rearrangetabsbyfirstletter: Quick alphabetization of buffers where all buffers with the same starting letter are put together. Only the file name is
" considered, not the path. So, at the end, you get three tabs:
"
" Tab 1: Abcd.java
" Tab 2: ProgramRunner.java
" Tab 3: TabManager.vim and Test.java
"
" (The tabs are sorted as are the results within each tab.)
"
" Rearrangetabsbyextension: Arranges by extension (.java or .vim, for example):
"
" Tab 1: Abcd.java, ProgramRunner.java and Test.java
" Tab 2: TabManager.vim
"
" Rearrangetabsbypath: Arranges by absolute file path (not taking filename into consideration):
"
" Tab 1: /progs/com/abc: Test.java
" Tab 2: /progs/com/test: Abcd.java and ProgramRunner.java
" Tab 3: /vim/plugin: TabManager.vim
"
" Tiletabs: Quick way to alphabetize the list of buffers (case sensitive) into regularly-sized (by number of buffers) tabs. Doesn't make sense to use this with
" 0 (all buffers in one tab), unless that's the effect you want.
"
" Rearrangetabs: The workhorse. All other other commands are defined through this. Takes the actual pattern criteria against which to match each buffer.
