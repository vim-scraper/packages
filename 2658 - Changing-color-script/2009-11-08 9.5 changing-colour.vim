" |                      background is light-ish but the Normal text is not     |
" |                      near the dark-light exchange yet. fixed this by        |
" |                      stretching the 'ease' area, or the 'ramping' zone of   |
" |                      the normal text. This ramping zone now covers this     |

" |                      Simplified the logic to just 'did i move to cause a    |
" |                      timer previously, and if so where, hence move the      |
" |                      opposite way'. Now it's pretty flawless apart from     |
" |                      when you're on the final line and this line has no     |

" |                      also when you try moving off this line it could go     |
" |                      funny (the cursor mysteriously jumps up a line) but    |
" |                      it's nothing serious.                                  |

" |                      Finally made the 'timer' well-behaved by detecting if  |
" |                      the cursor was on the first column of a line in the    |
" |                      case where there were too few lines to move up/down.   |
" |                      The cursor now moves *right* if you're at column 1     |
" |                      (first column), *not* left as before. The cursor now   |
" |                      moves left only if your cursor is *not* on column 1,   |
" |                      rather than indiscriminately move left Anyway, beeping/|
" |                      flashing should now almost go away. There is a case    |
" |                      that I can't handle and that's when there is only one  |
" |                      character in the file, in which case the editor beep/  |
" |                      flash once as it tries to do a 'timer' but there isn't |
" |                      any space to move 'right' to, but hopefully that       |
" |                      shouldn't be too bad.                                  |

" |                      There was a bug with the 'timer' routine which made vim|
" |                      flash/beep if there was not enough lines above to      |
" |                      temporarily move the cursor to (this causing the       |
" |                      'timer'.) This has now been fixed. If there are too    |
" |                      few lines the timer will try to move left and right    |
" |                      instead of up and down. There is a slight possibility  |
" |                      that the editor will beep at you if you are on the     |
" |                      first character or if there are no characters in the   |
" |                      file, but hopefully that should not be the case long   |
" |                      enough to bother. Also added a line set whichwrap=h,l  |
" |                      to minimise this flashing. If you like using this      |
" |                      script it is better to leave this on as it will        |

" |                      middle of the screen or the line above it. It got      |
" |                      confused because what had been true previously had     |
" |                      just changed. Now fixed. Did this by adding special    |
" |                      cases of where to move 'safely' if the cursor is a)    |
" |                      bang in the middle and b) directly *above* the middle. |
" |                      Did this using a 'middle' flag and an 'abovemiddle'    |
" |                      flag. Ugly but it does the job. (Sorry, but I'm not    |

" |                      which occasionally (depending on where your cursor was)|

" |                      has now been fixed. The 'timer' hack is a bit more     |
" |                      intelligent. It now moves only where nothing would     |

" |                      This affects Constant at darker background, Statement  |

" | RGBEl function used to work out offsetting for RGB components pertaining to  |
" | a background, i.e. the bit that says guibg= of the vim highlight command.    |
" | Background is handled different to foreground so it needs another function.  |
" | You can tell this RGBEl function what to do with the background if RGB value |
" | is *just* below the 'danger' general background, and above it. In each case  |
" | you can tell it to brighten or darken the passed RGB value. (darkAdj,        |
" | lghtAdj params.) Positive values, (e.g. 40) add brightness, nagative values  |
" | remove it. Special cases 99 and -99 adds does this in a 'default' measure.   |
" | You can also tell the function what to do if the RGB value is right inside   |
" | the danger zone; not to be confused with darkAdj & lghtAdj that mean the     |
" | two end tips outside of the danger area. This bit is the danger area itself, |
" | the low-visisibility area, the 'danger zone'. (dangerZoneAdj) It works the   |
" | same, a positive value causes background to brighten, a negative to darken.  |
" | Like darkAdj & lghtAdj, you can also specify default 'brighten' or 'darken', |
" | 99 or -99 respectively, but if you're not happy with the default just fine   |
" | tune it exactly as you would like it to look exactly as you do with darkAdj  |
" | & lghtAdj. Use this if you find using the normal foreground text colour      |
" | modification by itself (RGBEl2 function) doesn't cut it. Text still looks    |
" | blurry over a certain background colour even after you've adjusted the danger|
" | adjustment parameters available in RGBEl2. Normally I found darkening text   |
" | with RGBEl2 adjustment params makes the text 'visible' over danger zone but  |
" | in some cases it wasn't up to it, so I added this param: 'dangerZoneAdj'.    |
" | This allows you to 'fudge' the background colour up and down as desired until|
" | you're happy with the result.                                                |
" | Return value is either the up or down-shifted RGB background element if the  |
" | element falls just outside the 'danger' boundary, a shifted-up RGB element   |
" | if the value is fully inside the danger boundary (and you set dangerZoneAdj) |
" | or simply the same as you pass if the value you pass is outside the danger   |
" | zone AND the outer boundary ring of the 'danger zone'.                       |
