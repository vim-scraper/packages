" |                      Made a fix so that the background now lightens         |
" |                      and darkens, lightens and darkens, etc.. using a       |

" |                      and light magenta. This means that the background now  |
" |                      lightens-up using a certain shade, darkens down in     |
" |                      another shade, then lightens-up in yet another, and so |
" |                      on. for a total of six different colours over 3 hours. |
" |                      I've tried to make it so that the background simulates |
" |                      the way the real sky colours at morning time and then  |
" |                      colours at evening time and then again at morning time,|

" |                    . A bit of icing on the cake really, made the cursor     |

" |                      lightness. It's better than before as before it just   |
" |                      turned a darker yellow and this was dull and           |
" |                      unimaginative and didn't out. Now with the red         |
" |                      the cursor looks nice and strong at a lighter          |

" |                    . The same as before but made the brightening work a     |
" |                      bit more 'blended-in' with the background, so as the   |
" |                      background lightens the Normal element kicks-in a bit  |
" |                      stronger with its own lightening so that it doesn't    |
" |                      get 'out-lightened' by the lighter background, while   |
" |                      at the same time Normal doesn't lighten too strongly   |
" |                      at darker background ranges to compensate for the fact |
" |                      that contrast is better anyway. Now Normal blends in   |
" |                      very nicely throughout all background lightnesses.     |

" |                      Normal identifier had, now this simply brightens a bit |
" |                      when the background and it start to clash. It now looks|
" |                      reasonably pleasing to the eye as time passes, rather  |

" |                    . For some reason the Identifiers got some bad values,   |
" |                      not very optimal. Must have had a bad day. This is     |
" |                      quite nice, tuned in at light and dark background      |

" |                      as Normal and that this looks boring. Have changed     |
" |                      this now to look more of a pale or dark blue depending |
" |                      on which looks best relative the background.           |

" |                    . Had to darken the Identifier around the area where it  |
" |                      looks bad with the background. I had made this weaker  |
" |                      but it's too weak. This is fixed and now it's quite    |
" |                      nice, not too dark - you can see the green- but darker.|
" |                      5.9                                                    |
" |                    . My mistake got some bad values into Identifier somehow |
" |                      this has been fixed sorry. Was getting super-dark      |
" |                      instead of just turning a slightly darker shade of     |
" |                      green where the visibility gets bad with the           |
" |                      background.                                            |

" |                    . Added some colours to the Javascript colour coding     |
" |                      as it looks very poor otherwise. Constant numbers      |
" |                      in JavaScript now behave the same as PHP Constants.    |
" |                      Javascript brackets now behave the same as PHP         |
" |                      punctuation symbols.                                   |

" |                    . Found that making Visual a bit milder made it a bit    |
" |                      difficult to read sometimes so made it a little bit    |
" |                      stronger so hopefully it still doesn't obstruct text   |
" |                      but is clear enough to see.                            |
" |                      5.6                                                    |
" |                    . Still experienced problems with visibility of 'Directo-|
" |                      ry', not noticed before because Directory does not     |
" |                      often appear - occurs inside the :Ex command (File     |
" |                      Browse). Now this looks both beautiful and easy to see |
" |                      at any lightness. Made Visual a bit less strong as this|
" |                      was previously was blocking out the text. Now it's     |
" |                      only a shade different to make sure the selected text  |
" |                      text stays visible.                                    |

" |                    . Cured disastrous visibility failure of Directories in  |
" |                      the file browser command :Ex. Directory was almost     |
" |                      totally invisible at a particular background lightness |
" |                      as it happened exactly when I needed to see what       |
" |                      directory I was in. Update to this script now and this |
" |                      wont happen to you.                                    |

" |                    . Stretched the 'lighting-up time' of Identifier a bit   |
" |                      later into the darkness. The 'lighting-up' was         |
" |                      coming-up slightly before it 'got really dark', so this|
" |                      looked silly. Now Identifier feels more like it lights |
" |                      up at exactly the correct time.                        |
" | THU 30TH JUL 2009: o 5.3                                                    |
" |                      Fine-tuned the visibility protection of Comment so that|
" |                      it now looks great around the dark background area.    |
" |                      Previously was looking a bit muggy. Stretched this     |
" |                      protection exactly around the perceptional boundary    |
" |                      area and fined-tuned the 'back-darkening' effect at    |
" |                      this lower range as well so that it now just does that |
" |                      job it should do.                                      |
" |                    o VER 5.2                                                |
" |                    . Made the backgrounds fade very smoothly, as i found    |
" |                      that there were still inconsistencies. They have now   |
" |                      have been fixed. The colours of the background now     |
" |                      blend smoothly from dark to light. Fixed sudden        |
" |                      brightening that occurred of the of background. Now the|
" |                      transition is sweet. Also the background stays         |
" |                      consistently coloured. Previously it would go dark     |
" |                      green and suddently change to a very light-red colour. |
" |                      A slight glitch that is now corrected by manipulating  |
" |                      R,G,B values better. Hour 1: dark-brown to light       |
" |                      yellow. Hour 2: dark-green to light-green. Hour 3: dark|
" |                      grey-purple to light-pink.                             |

" |                    . Made Identifier have the 'lights on' look a bit later  |
" |                      so that when this happens seems about the right time   |
" |                      with relation to how dark the background is. Previously|
" |                      Idenfier became 'lights on' well before the background |
" |                      was really that dark and this looked a bit stupid.     |
" |                    o VER 5.0                                                |
" |                    . Realised that the background was not continuous on the |
" |                      second hour. Made the background fading continuous, so |
" |                      it looks like there's continuity. Hour 1 background    |
" |                      fades smoothly between dark-blue to light-yellow. Hours|
" |                      2 it goes smoothly from dark-green to a lighter green. |
" |                      Finally hour 3 the background goes smoothly from a     |
" |                      dark-red to a light pinky colour. I feel that whilst   |
" |                      these are not the prettiest shades ever, that they are |
" |                      at least doing the job. I need to try these out fully  |
" |                      to get a feel for how they're working and hence get    |
" |                      better shades, but for now they're working. (Look      |
" |                      smooth). Watch this space for better ideas.            |
" |                    o VER 4.9                                                |
" |                    . made the visibility-protection of Identifier a bit less|
" |                      glary. Previously i was trying to use brightening of   |
" |                      the background to improve visibility but it was too    |
" |                      strong. This was my fault. I was trying to improve it. |
" |                      Apologies. I've now corrected this so that Identifier  |
" |                      remains remain nice and easy on the eyes as the back-  |
" |                      ground fades from dark-light and vice versa.           |

" |                    . removed display of time. This is redundant now that the|
" |                      changing colours help you keep track of time better.   |
" |                    o VER 4.7                                                |
" |                    . made a slight boo-boo in that the speed being quicker  |
" |                      of the background changes also meant that the          |
" |                      frequency of the updates speeds up. Did not realise    |
" |                      this. My mistake, poor programmer here. Fixed it now so|
" |                      that by default the background updates only every      |
" |                      minute.                                                |
" |                    o VER 4.6                                                |
" |                    . changed the speed at which background shifts from light|
" |                      to dark and vice-versa so that instead of going        |
" |                      gradually from dark to light over the hour then back   |
" |                      in the next hour, the background now does so in a half |
" |                      hour slots so the same as happened over two hours      |
" |                      before now happens over one hour. The 'shaded          |
" |                      backgrounds' added in 4.2 keep it interesting as on    |
" |                      hour 1 the colour shades differently to what it does on|
" |                      hour 2, and again to what it does on hour 3. If you    |
" |                      feel this is too sudden stick to script version 4.5    |
" |                      as this version does this more gradually over 2-hour   |
" |                      slots.                                                 |

" +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
" | RGBEl function used to work out offsetting for RGB components pertaining to  |
" | a background, i.e. the bit that says guibg= of the vim highlight command.    |
" | Background is handled different to foreground so it needs another function.  |
" | You can tell this RGBEl function what to do with the background if RGB value |
" | is *just* below the 'danger' general background, and above it. In each case  |
" | you can tell it to brighten or darken the passed RGB value. (darkAdj,        |
" | lghtAdj params.) Positive values, (e.g. 40) add brightness, nagative values  |
" | remove it. Special cases 99 and -99 adds does this in a 'default' measure.   |
" | You can also tell the function what to do if the RGB value is right inside   |
" | the danger zone; not to be confused with darkAdj & lghtAdj that mean the     |
" | two end tips outside of the danger area. This bit is the danger area itself, |
" | the low-visisibility area, the 'danger zone'. (dangerZoneAdj) It works the   |
" | same, a positive value causes background to brighten, a negative to darken.  |
" | Like darkAdj & lghtAdj, you can also specify default 'brighten' or 'darken', |
" | 99 or -99 respectively, but if you're not happy with the default just fine   |
" | tune it exactly as you would like it to look exactly as you do with darkAdj  |
" | & lghtAdj. Use this if you find using the normal foreground text colour      |
" | modification by itself (RGBEl2 function) doesn't cut it. Text still looks    |
" | blurry over a certain background colour even after you've adjusted the danger|
" | adjustment parameters available in RGBEl2. Normally I found darkening text   |
" | with RGBEl2 adjustment params makes the text 'visible' over danger zone but  |
" | in some cases it wasn't up to it, so I added this param: 'dangerZoneAdj'.    |
" | This allows you to 'fudge' the background colour up and down as desired until|
" | you're happy with the result.                                                |
" | Return value is either the up or down-shifted RGB background element if the  |
" | element falls just outside the 'danger' boundary, a shifted-up RGB element   |
" | if the value is fully inside the danger boundary (and you set dangerZoneAdj) |
" | or simply the same as you pass if the value you pass is outside the danger   |
" | zone AND the outer boundary ring of the 'danger zone'.                       |
