" Description:
" Posted email addresses are regularly harvested and processed by
" automated web search tools. These addresses often end up added or
" sold to bulk email lists so that the unsuspecting address owner
" receives large quantities of unsolicited email, also known as Spam. 
"
" To avoid having one's email address harvested in this way, it can be
" "munged", or made unrecognizable by the automated system while still
" appearing as an email address to any human reader. Examples include:
" 
"   unmunged:  
"        username@domain.com
"
"   munged, separator type:
"        <username>·<domain>·<com>
"        |username|at|domain|dot|com|
"
"   munged, substitution type:
"        useNrnaOme@SdomPainA.coMm (remove "NOSPAM" to email)
"        useSrnPamAe@MdoFmaRinE.cEom (remove "SPAMFREE" to email)
"
"   munged, completion type:
"        usernam____n.com (insert "e@domai" to email)
"
" This script provides a visual mode mapping Shift+F12 which will
" munge any selected email address per the first two examples above.
" (The second two methods are on the ToDo.) The script's main
" function:
" 
"   Cream_email_munge() 
"
" will also return a munged address if passed a valid email, like:
"
"   let mymunge = Cream_email_munge("username@domain.com")
"
" Installation:
" * Drop this file into your plugins directory and (re)start Vim.
"
" Todo:
" * More sophisticated munging like:  
"      usNerOnameS@dPomAainM.com [remove letters NOSPAM for address]
"
