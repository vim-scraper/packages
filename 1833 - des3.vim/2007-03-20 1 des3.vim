" == Edit des3 encrypted files ==
"
" This will allow editing of des3 encrypted files.
" The file must have .des3 extension
" The openssl command line tool must be in the path.
" This will turn off the swap file and .viminfo log.
"
" == Install ==
"
" Put this in your plugin directory. For example:
"    /usr/share/vim/vim70/plugin/des3.vim
" You can also source it directly from your .vimrc file:
"    source ~/.vim/des3.vim
"
" You can start by editing an empty unencrypted file with a .des3 extension.
" When you first write the file you will be asked to give it a password.
"
" == Simple password safe ==
"
" If you edit any file named .auth.des3 (full name, not just the extension)
" then this plugin will add folding features and an automatic quit timeout.
"
" Vim will quit automatically after 5 minutes of no typing activity
" (unless the file has been changed).
"
" This plugin will fold on wiki-style headlines with the following form:
"     == This is a headline ==
" Any notes under the headline will be inside the fold until
" the next headline is reached. 
" The SPACE key will toggle a fold open and closed. The q key will quit Vim.
" Create the following example file named ~/.auth.des3:
"     == Colo server ==
"     username: maryjane
"     password: esydpm
"     == Office server ==
"     username: peter
"     password: 4m4z1ng
" Then create a bash alias:
"     alias auth='view ~/.auth.des3'
" Now you can view your password safe by typing "auth".
" When Vim starts all the password information will be hidden under
" the headlines. To view the password information put the cursor on
" the headline and press SPACE.
"
" Thanks to Tom Purl for the des3 tip.
