" Vim script file
" Language:	Use with scribble syntax
" Last Change:	2011-09-30
" Author:	Tim Brown <tim.brown@timb.net>
" Version: 1.1
"
" Suggestions and bug reports (and fixes!) are solicited by the author.
"
" This script works with racket.vim (and scribble.vim if you have it) to
" automatically populate the syntax keywords lists
"
" Install it in ~/.vim/scripts
"
" Use the binding:
"  map <C-F4> :runtime scripts/racket-auto-syntax.vim
" in your .vimrv
"
"
" Issues:
" * Currently, I can't get this to run in an autocommand, so I have it bound
"   using control-F4
"
" * Anyone who can get this to work with scribble.vim, without vim SEGVing --
"   please contact me.
"
