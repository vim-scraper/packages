" :call F()
" This function lets you see all the lines in a file
" that contain a given regular-expression.
"
" The remaining lines are folded with the manual method,
" and can be opened to see some 'nearby' line.
"
" The idea comes from the mainframe ISPF editor.
"
" zo   to open a fold a bit
" zozj to open a fold a bit and leave the cursor on the fold line
" zO   to open a fold completely 
" zE   to open all folds
"
" zf{motion} to close folders 'a bit more' (or to create folders)
" If you have 2 adjacent folders, zf<ENTER> will 'merge' them.
" In the same way a visible line can be 'added' to a nearby folder.
"
" Suggested mappings:
" :map <F5> :call F()<CR>
" :map <F6> :normal zozj<CR>
" :set backspace=indent,eol,start
" the above setting allows you to go back/forward with "w","b" etc.
" thus opening "a bit" a nearby folder
" 
" :<Up> to recall the macro after having executed it once
" giving <Up> as an argument, last searches can be repeated/modified
"
