" Title: Side-C (a simple IDE for C/C++)
" Maintainer: Boyko Bantchev <boykobb@gmail.com>
" URI: http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/vim/side-c.vim
" Version: 1.1+ / 2008 December 15
" Usage: Source this file (:so side-c.vim), or put it in a plugin directory,
"        then use the key mappings and the menu

" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" "What"
"
" A set of functions and a menu "C/C++" implementing a simple IDE for working
" with single-file C and C++ programs.  Used as a plug-in.  Makes the basic
" edit-compile-run loop of C and C++ programs easier for Vim users.  Currently
" set up to work with both Linux (gcc) and DOS/Windows (djgpp-gcc); can be
" easily customized for other command-line compilers and/or other o.s.
"
" "Why"
"
" Vim already has the necessary components for integrating compilation and run
" of a program within the editor: calling external programs, reading the error
" messages of a compiler and displaying them in a dedicated window, etc.
" However, some work still needs to be done manually if one is using a plain
" Vim.  Here are several sources of inconvenience in this respect.
"
"   * Depending on the operating system, the file type (C or C++), and one's
"     preferences, there may be a need to call different compilers in each
"     different case, and this is not easy to specify and vary in a typical
"     work session.
"
"   * When the compiler is called, normally through :make, the file to be
"     compiled must be the current one for the editor.
"
"   * The Quickfix window -- the one where the compiler error messages are
"     displayed, must be manually opened and closed.  The best one can do is
"     using :cw[indow] for both, but that is still a manual action.
"
"   * In order to run a program from within Vim, one has not only to type its
"     name as an argument to a :! command; often, the complete path name must
"     be typed, as Vim will only look for the program in its current directory,
"     which may be different from where the program is.  The executable is
"     usually in the same directory as the C/C++ source, but Vim, unless
"     specially instructed to do so, does not make use of this (and it shouldn't
"     -- it is an editor, not a programming system).
"
"   * Sometimes it is useful to redirect the standard input, output or both
"     -- leading to even more manual typing.
"
"   * At times, one may need to browse the directory where a certain edited file
"     resides, or to run an o.s. command shell in that directory.  These too are
"     not directly supported by the plain Vim.
"
" For a more comfortable and productive use of Vim as a programming editor, some
" programming-directed automation is needed, and a simple form of such automation
" is provided by this plug-in.
"
" "Operation"
"
" When loaded, automatically or by `sourcing' it, the script creates several key
" mappings and a menu.  Both implement the same set of actions.  The menu lists
" the mapped keys, along with the names of the respective actions.
"
" As Side-C directly supports only single-file programs, all program-related
" actions -- ones that involve compiling and linking or running a program -- can
" only be executed if there is exactly one C or C++ file on the current tab page
" of the editor.  There may be other, `non-program' files open, or the same file
" can be open in more than one window.
"
" The content of the other tab pages, if any, is irrelevant to Side-C's operation.
" It is possible to have different programs open in different tab pages.  Side-C
" will treat them separately.
"
" It doesn't matter whether the C or C++ file is in the currently active window
" (where the cursor is) or not; it is Side-C's care to find it.
"
" Note that `a program file' means precisely a disk file being edited in Vim,
" not an unnamed buffer.  Moreover, a program file is recognized by its name
" extension.  A file with a .c name extension is regarded as a C file; one with
" .cc, .c++, .cpp, or .cxx is a C++ file (the letter case is ignored).
"
" When compiling and linking, if the current window does not contain the program
" file, the first window that does is made the current window.  Before compiling,
" if the program file has yet unwritten changes, it is saved.  If the compilation
" results in syntax errors, the Quickfix window is open with the error messages
" listed in it.
"
" The "Run" command is executed by first compiling & linking if necessary.
" Building the executable file takes place if such a file does not currently
" exist in the directory of the source file, or if it is older than the source
" (which may be due to the source file being automatically saved, as described
" above).  When compiling fails due to syntax errors in the source file, the
" program is not run.
"
" It is also possible to run a program in several other ways, redirecting as
" follows:
"
"   * only the standard input, to a file named "in";
"
"   * only the standard output, to a file named "out";
"
"   * both the standard input, to a file named "in", and the standard output,
"     to a file named "out";
"
"   * the standard input is redirected to a visual selection within some text,
"     currently open in the editor (no matter which file on the current tab
"     page); the output from the program replaces the selection (this is
"     precisely executing :'<,'>!prog).
"
" In the redirected execution modes, the program is not automatically re-build
" (so do that using the "Compile & Link" command, if needed).  The file "in"
" must reside in the same directory where the executable and its source are.
" If an "out" file is created, it is also written in that directory.
"
" Additionally, there are commands that list the contents of the directory of
" the current file, and run a command shell in that directory.  (In Windows, a
" true console window is opened for the latter action, while in Linux it's a
" pseudo-console within Vim.)  These actions are of general use, not immediately
" related to programming.  They can be executed in any window, including one
" with a directory listing in it.  If the window does not contain a named file,
" Vim's current directory is used as a name.
"
" Note that, when executed in a directory window, the two commands *preserve*
" the listed directory (rather than going to its parent).  Namely, "List ..."
" opens a copy of the same directory, and "Run a Shell" runs in that directory.
" In a directory window, a useful idiom for opening a file is to list the same
" directory by duplicating it in a new window, and then open the file by
" selecting it from the second list.  The selected file replaces the contents
" of the respective window, while the other window still keeps the directory
" listing.
"
" Running a shell in the directory where a certain program is may be used to
" execute the program in ways not represented by the Side-C's commands, such
" as redirecting to files other than `in' and `out', or through a pipe.
