" PURPOSE: {{{
"   - Performs Vim commands over files recursively under multiple
"   directories.
"
"   - This plugin is like :argdo but it works recursively under a directory (or
"   multiple directories).  The limitation for :argdo is that it does not glob
"   the files inside the subdirectories.  DirDo works in a similar manner but
"   you're allowed to specify multiple directories (good for refactoring code
"   and modifying files in a deep hierarchy).  DirDo also globs the files in
"   the subdirectories so you can make sure an operation is performed
"   consistantly.
"   
" REQUIREMENTS:
"   - The :argdo command in Vim 6.0
"
" USAGE:
"   Put this file in your ~/.vim/plugin directory.
"
"   The syntax of the commands:
"
"   First we need to set what directory we would like to perform this
"   command on
"
"       :DirDoDir [/my/directory1] [/my/directory2] [/my/directory3]
"
"       or
"
"       :DDD [/my/directory1] [/my/directory2] [/my/directory3]
"
"   If no argument is given, then it'll display the directories that you're
"   going to work on and let you edit them by separating them with commas
"   (',')
"
"   Then we set the file glob pattern
"
"       :DirDoPattern [file glob pattern1] [file glob pattern2] ...
"
"       or
"
"       :DDP [file glob pattern1] [file glob pattern2] ...
"
"   If no argument is given, then it'll display the patterns and let you
"   edit them (separate each pattern with spaces).
"
"   Then, you can do:
"
"       :DirDo [commands]
"
"       or
"
"       :DDO [commands]
"
"   to executes the commands on each file that matches the glob pattern
"   recursively under the directories that you have specified.  The format of
"   [commands] is just like what you do on :argdo. See :help argdo for
"   details.
"
"   If no argument is given, then it'll reuse the last command.
"
"   Examples:
"
"   Replace all the instaces of "Foo" to "Bar" in all the Java or C files under
"   the directory /my/directory and its subdirectories, confirming each match:
"
"       :DDD /my/directory (or just :DDD<CR> and type it in)
"       :DDP *.java *.c (or just :DDP<CR> and type it in)
"       :DDO %s/Foo/Bar/gce | update
"
"   (See :h argdo for the commands after DDO.)
"
"   Same scenario but replacing "Bar" with "Baz" without confirmation for each
"   match (note the directory and patterns are saved):
"
"       :DDO %s/Bar/Baz/ge | update
"
"
"   There is an option to run DirDo with less verbosity, to toggle the
"   setting, run:
"
"       :DirDoVerbose
"
"       or
"
"       :DDV
"
"   You can also set the following variables in your .vimrc to set the default
"   directory and pattern.  This is good for pointing to the directories for
"   code refactoring:
"
"   let g:DirDoPattern = "..."
"
"   let g:DirDoDir = "..."
"
"   For example, if you want by default have the command apply on all your C,
"   C++, and Java source, you can set the DirDoPattern to:
"
"   let g:DirDoPattern = "*.c *.cpp *.java"
"
"   If you want to apply your changes to /dir1, /dir2, and /dir3, you can do:
"
"   let g:DirDoDir = "/dir1,/dir2,/dir3"
