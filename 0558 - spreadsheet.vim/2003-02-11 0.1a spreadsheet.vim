" Version: 0.1a
" ChangeLog:
" 	0.1a :  Added mapping and command for quick cell definition
" 		cell will allow quick insertion of cell labels
" 		command :Cell with or without cell label do the same
"
" 		Added translation for different number sintax
" 		
" Acknowledgement:
" Installation:
" 	Simply copy this file in your .vim/plugin directory.
" Use:
"	This script lets you use vim as a spreadsheet, adding aritmetic
"	calculations to your text files.
"	It provides three simple functions:
"	
"		Get("CellName"): 	  Returns the value of a cell.
"		Set("CellName","Value"):  Sets the value of a cell.
"		Calculate("Operation"):   Returns the result of the operation
"
"	Note: Calculate uses 'bc' command.
"
"	To create a cell simply put the string "(#Name)" BEFORE the WORD you
"	want to become a cell. No closing mark is required, because the first
"	WORD after the mark will be used. 
"
"	You can also use the :Cell <label> command. If no label is given you
"	will be prompted for input.
"		
"		:Cell CellLable
"
"	Or the mapping "cell" at command mode. 
"	
"	For Example: In the following text "Price1", "Price2", "Sum", "VAT"
"	and "Tot" are cell labels:
"
"	BILL
"		Item 1			(#Price1) 1.700,00 euros
"		Item 2			(#Price2)    30,75 euros
"		SUM			(#Sum)        0 euros
"		V.A.T.			(#VAT)        0 euros
"		TOTAL			(#Tot)	      0 euros
"
"	You can then use the functions to create formulas for your file.
"
"	a) Formulas can be directly writen at the command line:
"
"		:call Set("Sum", Calculate(Get("Price1")."+".Get("Price2")))
"
"	b) You can define commands in a script to easily recall commonly used
"	formulas:
"
"		:command VAT :call Set("VAT", Calculate(Get("Sum")."*0.16"))
"
"		And then execute it with:
"
"		:VAT
"
"	c) You can map those commands to access them quicker
"	
"		:map <F2> :VAT<CR>
"
"		And then simply press <F2> to execute it.
"
"	The Calculate function uses the bc operative system command. This is
"	the only way I have found to perform "advanced" operations, as decimal
"	additions. This may not work on non Linux operating systems.
"
"	You can change the default precision of the Calculate function (which
"	is 2 decimal digits) by setting the g:spreadsheet_precision variable
"	in your .vimrc
"
"	The script translates from "your" number sintax to bc required sintax,
"	(which is no thousand separator and "." as decimal separator (this
"	could be different in your sistem)) to a human sintax (by default, "."
"	as the thousand separator and "," as the decimal separator). This
"	values may be changed defining g:spreadsheet_thousand and
"	g:spreadsheet_decimal variables.
"
"	Also you can disable number sintax translation asigning
"	g:spreadsheet_translate the value 0
"
" TODO:
" 	Actually, no error control is implemented. You can try to add two non
" 	numeric words and get a horrible "parse error" result. This will be
" 	solved in next release (whenever it may come)
"
" 	You will also see that no alineation is done. I have no idea about how
" 	to solve this problem. Just edit the line and add or remove any space
" 	as required.
"
"	This script has only been tested in my computer, with my
"	configuration. The use of points, colons,... to define decimal points
"	may be different on other systems. If it doesn't work properly on your
"	system, send me an email and I'll try to do my best.
"
" Known Bugs:
"	ToHumanFormat functions gives unwanted result with negative values
"	less than 1000. Instead of -183,90 if gives -.183,90
