" rename.vim: functions to rename files and C symbols under the cursor.
" (Heavily inspired from renamec.vim)
"
" @maintainer       : <chm.duquesne@gmail.com>
" @license          : GPL (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt)
" @last modified    : 2010-03-21
" @todo             : find a way to allow the user to undo changes (using
"                     diff and patch?)
"
" @Features:
" :call Renamec(): renames the symbol under the cursor
" :call Renamef(): renames the file under the cursor and updates references
" to this file (like includes directives) in the given files
"
" Comparison with renamec:
" bugs fixed
" - the regular expression now matches entire words and is less likely to
"   provoke errors.
" - when used presses escape, the action is aborted.
" features added:
" - can now rename files
" - puts the renamed lines in the quickfix list (to check the changes and
"   update the commentaries)
