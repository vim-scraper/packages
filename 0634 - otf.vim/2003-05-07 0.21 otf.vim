"	\brief		On-The-Fly coloring of patterns, Inspired heavily by MultipleSearch.vim (2002 Nov 18, v1.1) by Dan Sharp <dwsharp at hotmail dot com>, this version allows specific colors for specific patterns and easy to redefine a pattern for a color, or uncolor a pattern.
"	\note		This is an evolution of my FERAL_MatchWord (that used :match)
"	\note		This is VIMSCRIPT#634, http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=634.
"	\note		MultipleSearch.vim is VIMSCRIPT#479,

"	[Feral:127/03@01:38] 0.21
"		Improvement: As per a suggestion from Mathieu CLABAUT the feralotf#
"		highlight groups now use the default keyword, This allows you to
"		override these default colors easily.
"
"	[Feral:123/03@12:06] 0.2
"		Small update: converted :OTF1-8 into :OTF which takes a count (line
"			number position) and takes optional bang to specify string as a
"			keyword (think register)
"		Keywords are:
"			(w) cword,                     expand("<cword>")
"			(W) \<cword\>                  "\\<".expand("<cword>")."\\>"
"			(") unnamed register           @@
"			(/) current search string      @/
"		i.e. ":2OTF! /" (bang) will pull in the current search string and
"			color it in color group2, while ":2OTF /" (no bang) will color '/'
"			in color group2
"		Original :OTF1-8 commands updated to bang style but commented out
"			(just in case anyone liked that method(no count))
"
"	[Feral:122/03@21:26] 0.1
"		Initial
"		Pieces from Dan Sharp's MultipleSearch.vim and base idea from my
"			(unpublished) FERAL_MatchWord.
"		This, happily, is what I wanted FERAL_MatchWord to be in the first
"			place.
"
"		There are bound to be ways to streamline the usage of this still,
"			for instance I normally :OTF1 <C-r><c-w> or <c-r>" and ocasionally
"			<c-r>/ ... lots of flexability but more typing than desired.
"	}}}
"
"	Usage: {{{
"	There are 2 commands, 1 to clear all highlighting, 1 to manipulate
"		individule color groups.
"	:OTFReset -- to clear all highlighting done by this script. (think :noh)
"		This can probably be shortened to :OTFR on the command line.
"
"	:OTF -- takes a count (line number position) to specify the color group to
"		use (1-8). blank string clears highlighting for the specified color
"		group, while the bang (:OTF!) denotes that the specifed string should
"		be treated as a keyword (think register), see below:
"
"	Use Like So:
"		Highlight Current Word Under The Cursor:
"		:1OTF <c-r><c-w>
"		:1OTF! w
"		Highlight Current Search Pattern:
"		:1OTF <c-r>/
"		:1OTF! /
"		Use A Pattern From A Register:
"		:1OTF <c-r>"
"		:1OTF! "
"		Just Type The Pattern In Manually:
"		:1OTF \cotf\d
"		Turn Off Coloring For The First Highlight Group:
"		:1OTF
"		:1OTF!
"		Turn Off Coloring For The Second Highlight Group: (etc.)
"		:2OTF
"		:2OTF!
"		Turn Off Coloring For All Groups:
"		:OTFReset
"		Which can probably be shortened to:
"		:OTFR
"
"	Defining Your Own Colors:
"	Thanks to a suggestion by Mathieu CLABAUT the default highlight groups use
"		the default keyword, this allows you to specify feralotf# to override
"		the default color group. See :h :highlight-default
"
"	Thus you could have something like this in your favorite color file to
"		override the first 4 color groups.
" {{{ OVERRIDE On the fly highlight groups.
"hi feralotf1		guifg=#4682B4 guibg=Linen
"hi feralotf2		guifg=Linen
"hi feralotf3		guifg=Linen guibg=azure4
"hi feralotf4		guifg=Linen guibg=PaleGreen4
