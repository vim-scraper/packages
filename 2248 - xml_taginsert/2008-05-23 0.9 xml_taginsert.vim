" Description: 
"    This maps the <F7> key to an xml tag inserter. When you press <F7> while
"    to cursor is on or directly after a word, the that word is transformed
"    into an xml tag, complete with closing tag. When the cusor is not over a
"    word, you will be prompted for a tag name. This works in insert and
"    comment mode.
"
"    This plugin depends on the imaps plugin that comes with the vim
"    latex-suite (vim-latex)
"
" Acknowlegements:
"    This script borrows adapts some code from the latex-suite set of
"    plugins.
"
" Installation:
"    Copy this file into your ftplugin directory. You may additionally want to
"    create a symlink to it as 'html_taginsert.vim', so that it is also loaded
"    when you edit html files.
