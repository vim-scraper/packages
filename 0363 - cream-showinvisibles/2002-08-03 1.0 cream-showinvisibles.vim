" cream-showinvisibles.vim
" 
" Description:
" Indicates "invisible" characters within text, such as tabs, spaces
" and returns. This setup includes nice looking characters, a global
" variable which gets retained if you're using viminfo, and a toggle
" function accessed by a familiar (to some of us) F4 key.
"
" One of the many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the
" Cream project ( http://cream.sourceforge.net ), a configuration of
" Vim in the vein of Apple and Windows software you already know.

" Instructions:
" * Simply copy this file and paste it into your vimrc. Or you can
"   drop the entire file into your plugins directory.
" * As long as you don't already have keyboard mappings to the F4 key,
"   it will toggle invisible characters.
"
" Notes:
" For more information see Vim's ":help 'list",  ":help 'listchars",
" and ":help viminfo".
