" Version: 0.3
" Last Updated: 25 July 2008

" This plugin allows you to use Google Desktop Search engine to search text
" files from within VIM. 
" This requires python, pygoogledesktop script, and Google Desktop Search engine installed.
" Right now, this is a Windows only program, until I find time to modify it
" for other OS's
"
" Instructions:
"
" Make sure the correct version of Python is installed on your machine that
" VIM supports.  Type :version and you should see a "+python" or "+python/dyn"
" If it is not there, then you cannot use this script.
" Also in that same version command, check for "DFEAT_PYTHON" to see
" where python is installed for VIM to use and make sure your python is
" located there.
"
" Make sure you have a copy of PyGoogleDesktop python package installed
" as well. http://code.google.com/p/pythongoogledesktop or if you have
" setuptools, do "easy_install pygoogledesktop" to install
"
" Install googlesearch.vim into your plugin directory
"
" To run use :GDS text
" where text is what you want to search for
"
" There are a couple of global variables you can set in your vimrc file
" to help with the search.
" 
" g:gds_numresults - 
" This variable handles the number of results returned from a search.  If 
" you want all results returned, specify a 0 as the value.  Specifying
" a 0 could result in long search times.
"
" g:gds_extensions -
" This variable holds the file extensions you want searched and returned
" to you.  Specify the extensions separated by a comma (e.g. 'cpp,java,hpp')
"
" The search will create a buffer with the results called "GDSResults". And put
" you cursor in that window.  From there you can usually just press "gf" to
" open the file you want to check out then do a normal search command
" on the search string i.e "/text"
"
" Changes
" v0.1: Initial revision
" v0.2: fixed buffer quirks, updated debug capability
" v0.3: still working out result buffer kinks
