" IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmds.vim: autocmds for IndentConsistencyCop.vim
"
" DESCRIPTION:
"   The autocmds in this script automatically trigger the IndentConsistencyCop
"   for certain, configurable filetypes (such as c, cpp, html, xml, which
"   typically contain lots of indented lines) once when you load the file in
"   VIM. The entire buffer will be checked for inconsistent indentation, and you
"   will receive a report on its findings. With this automatic background check,
"   you'll become aware of indentation problems before you start editing. 
"
" USAGE:
"   Triggering happens automatically; of cause, you can still start the
"   IndentConsistencyCop ex command to re-check the buffer after changes. 
"
"   For very large files, the check may take a couple of seconds. You can abort
"   the script run with CTRL-C, like any other VIM command. 
"
"   You can disable/re-enable the autocommands with 
"   :IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOff and :IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOff,
"   respectively. 
"
" INSTALLATION:
"   Put the script into your user or system VIM plugin directory (e.g.
"   ~/.vim/plugin). 
"
" DEPENDENCIES:
"   - Requires VIM 7.0 or higher. 
"   - Requires IndentConsistencyCop.vim (vimscript #1690). 
"
" CONFIGURATION:
"   If you don't like the default filetypes that are inspected, modify the
"   comma-separated list of filetypes in g:indentconsistencycop_filetypes.

" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS 
"   1.10.004	13-Jun-2008	Added -bar to all commands that do not take any
"				arguments, so that these can be chained together. 
"   1.10.003	21-Feb-2008	Avoiding multiple invocations of the
"				IndentConsistencyCop when reloading or switching
"				buffers. Now there's only one check per file and
"				VIM session. 
"   1.00.002	25-Nov-2006	Added commands :IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOn
"				and :IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOff
"				to re-enable/disable autocommands.

    " The straightforward way to ensure that the Cop is called only once per
    " file is to hook into the BufRead event. We cannot do this, because at that
    " point modelines haven't been set yet and the filetype hasn't been
    " determined. 
    " Although the BufWinEnter hook removes itself after execution, it may still
    " be triggered multiple times in a VIM session, e.g. when switching buffers
    " (alternate file, or :next, ...) or when a plugin (like FencView) reloads
    " the buffer with changed settings.
    " Thus, we set a buffer-local flag. This ensures that the Cop is really only
    " called once per file in a VIM session, even when the buffer is reloaded
    " via :e!. (Only :bd and :e <file> will create a fresh buffer and cause a
    " new Cop run.)
