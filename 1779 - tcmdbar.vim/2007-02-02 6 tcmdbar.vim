" Vim script for use with Total Commander's button bar.  It creates an
" argument list from all selected files and edits them.
"
" File:		tcmdbar.vim
" Last Change:	2007 Jan 28
" Author:	Andy Wokula <anwoku@yahoo.de>
" Version:	6
" Vim Version:	gVim 6.4 (only tested on gVim 7.0)
" OS:		Win32 only (maybe Win16)
"
" Thanks To:	Florian Trippel for reporting bugs.

" Installation:
" 1. Put this file in any directory (example: ~\vimfiles)
"    Note: This is not a plugin.
"
" 2. Create a new button for GVim in Total Commander's button bar.
"    (Example) Dialog for this:
"
"    Change button bar
"    Command:	 <path>\gvim.exe -S ~\vimfiles\tcmdbar.vim
"    Parameters: %L dummy
"    Start Path:
"    ...
"    Tooltip:	 Click to edit selected files or drag&drop a file
"
"    The "dummy" argument is a required dummy file name, its name is fixed.
"    You should not run into problems if this is an existing file.
"
"    From Totalcmd's help (in my words):
"     %L creates a list file in the TEMP-directory containing the names of
"	 all selected files and folders.  The name of the list file is added
"	 to the command line.  The list file is deleted after exiting the
"	 program.  The created list contains long file names including full
"	 path.
"
" Usage:
" The button can be used in the following ways:
"
" (1) Select one or more files and click the GVim-Button:
"     GVim starts up, loads the argument temp file (created by TC) and
"     sources this script to create an argument list.  Directories (ending
"     in a backslash) are silently removed from the list.  The temp file is
"     removed from the buffer list and the first argument is shown in a
"     buffer.  If only directories were selected an empty buffer is created.
"     Added: Will work with a flattened filelist (Totalcmd: Ctrl-B),
"     therefore the dummy argument is needed.
"
" (2) Drag&Drop a file onto the GVim-Button:
"     GVim loads the file argument the usual way.  If it is a directory, the
"     file explorer (GVim6) or the netrw plugin (GVim7) starts up
"     automatically (if plugins are not disabled).
"
" (3) To not load any file, first select the ".." directory and click the
"     GVim button.
"
" Customization: global variables for _vimrc
"   :let Tcmdbar_OpenIn = "Tabs"	open files in tabpages (Vim7 only)
"   :let Tcmdbar_OpenIn = "Windows"	open files in windows
"   You may get an error if there are too many files to open - don't worry,
"   just continue.
" --------------------------------------------------------------------------
"
" User options to be aware of: 'gdefault', 'shellslash'

" We must know whether a file argument is a Total Commander file list or
" not.  In fact this is easy (?!): use the number of arguments for decision.

" zero arguments: only ".." is selected in TC
" one argument: drag&drop - always one file
