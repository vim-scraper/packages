"   DOCUMENTATION
"
"
" YAPosting was designed in order to have a simple, but reliable set of
"mappings and functions, to accelerate the Mailing and Posting processus. I did
"see on <http://www.vim.org> if there was any scripts already done, and except
"for Posting.vim (which is dedicated to GVim, not vim), I didn't find any good
"ones...

" NOTE
"
"...So here I come, with this script, and with some ideas I had, like reformatting
"Microsoft's Outlook Express quotes, and put them at the right place, like
"formatting E-Mails with justification, and margins (unlike this text is written :)
"and of course some other nice functions.
"
"Of course, It needs lots of improvement, and please, give me feedback, or
"patches in order to do this -- My E-Mail is <bernard@pratz.net>. As you can
"see the TODO list is still quite big, and there's still a lot of work to do,
"but this script works as is, and the priority would be to find the bugs.
"

"
"                                                 - Bob Marley
"
" I did want this set of function easily reusable to make it possible for
" other people to use this set of script, where I did a lot of work for small
" but useful functions. So do not hesitate to look at the source below, I
" tried to document it as much as possible, and adapt them to your needs.
"
" So, I said all, now, please take the time to look at the documentation 
" below, where it is explained how to install, use and set up this script.
"
" May the posting side of the Force be with you :)
"
""
"   INSTALLATION
"
"        To use this script, copy it  in  your  ~/.vim/plugins/,  install
"    Perl v5.8.3 and then type in your editor `:call YAPConfPerl()',  which
"    follows :

function! YAPConfPerl()
    exe "perl use CPAN;"
    exe "perl install Text::Format"
endfunction

"    or at least simply install the package `Text::Format' from the CPAN.
" WHAT DOES THIS SCRIPT ?

"  Actually, this script is a set of functions, easy to use and re-use :
"  
"  - Take Out Function :                                           (default: tt)
"
" This function takes out the paragraph where the cursor is and removes it.
" It does work on quoted and not quoted paragraphs.
"
"  - Reformat Function :                                           (default: tr)
"
" This function justifies a paragraph respecting the current Paging Setup of
" the script (see PAGE SETUP below).
"
"  - Clean Reply :                                  (defaults: tr|t<UP>|t<DOWN>)
"
" This function removes the quoted signature, the quoted empty lines, condense
" the quote signs and place the cursor where the user want it to be :
"
"   tr      : let the cursor at the same position
"   t<UP>   : move the cursor at the top of the citation
"   t<DOWN> : move the cursor at the end of the citation
"
" To know more about the functions, know what are the bugs and what are the
" feature I'm working on, have a look at the functions' headers.

"* April, 8th 2004 * Version 0.1 ***********************************************
"
"  This is a little hack, more in the todo list than in the Code...

"*******************************************************************************
"
"   CONFIGURATION
"
"   You have to Configure variables in CONFIGURATION -> VARIABLES folder
"   below.
"
"
" PAGE SETUP 
"
"        The following shows the rules  that  I  choosed  to  format  the
"    e-mails. You can change any of those values to personnalize it.
"

"   <--> 4 [alinea]
"       Hee hee heh. Stop! What... is your name? It is 'Arthur', King of
"   the Britons. What... is your quest? To seek the Holy Grail.  What...
"   is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow? What do  you  mean?
"   An African or European swallow? Huh? I-- I don't know that.

"
"

" KEY MAPPINGS
"
"       I choosed  simple  keymappings...  I  don't  know  any  mappings
"   beginning with 't', if it's already taken, please let me know,  I'll
"   choose something better for the defaults. 
"   
"   So here are the default keymaps :
"
"   - `tt' will Take Out the current paragraph (calling TakeOut() below)
"   - `tr' will reformat the current parapraph (calling Format() below)
"   - `tm' will reformat a quoted OE mail (calling OEQuoteFix() below)
"   - `tc' will do a complete cleaning of the mail (calling CleanReply()
"      below)
"   - `t<UP>' will clean the mail, and put the cursor at the top of the
"      citation
"   - `t<DOWN>' will clean the mail, and put the cursor at the end of the
"      citation
"   - `th' will toggle improved highlights
"
"   You can of course change them, by changing the values in the folder :
"   CONFIGURATION -> KEY MAPPINGS. To know more about the called functions
"   read the previous chapter about them.
