" Description:  This is a vim plugin used as an independent built-in
"               IME (Input Method Editor) to input Chinese using vim
"               omni completion feature. The input method could be
"               anything, depending on the data file.
" Installation: (a) download a sample data file from below link
"               (b) save this file and data file in the plugin directory 
"   Data File:  http://maxiangjiang.googlepages.com/ChineseIME.dict
" Screen Shot:  http://maxiangjiang.googlepages.com/vim_ime.gif
"    Features:  (a) Chinese can be input if it can be read within vim
"               (b) It is independent of the Operating System
"               (c) It is independent of vim |+multi_byte_ime| API
"               (d) The data file is under one's own control
"               (e) The input method is controlled by the data file

"  Assumptions:
"  (1) Chinese can be read from within vim
"  (2) The utf-8 format is used both in memory and on disk
"  (3) The .vimrc is correctly set, for example, on my W2K box:
"      set enc=utf8
"      set gfn=Courier_New:h12:w7
"      set gfw=SimSun-18030,Arial_Unicode_MS

"  The data file:
"  The basic format of the data file is made of three columns:
"
"  +=========+=========+=========+
"  |column A |column B |column C |
"  +---------+---------+---------+
"  |  <key>  | <space> | <value> |
"  +=========+=========+=========+
"  |   ma    |         |    é¦¬   |
"  +=========+=========+=========+
"
"  The <key> is what is typed in alphabet, ready to be replaced.
"  The <apace> can be any whitespace character in any combination
"  The <value> is what will be input
"
"  In principle, any input method (Wubi, Pinyin, Four corner, etc)
"  can be used as long as a data file is made available.
"
"  A sample data file based on Pinyin can be found from
"  http://maxiangjiang.googlepages.com/ChineseIME.dict
"  It has 30127 lines, which are extracted from
"  http://maxiangjiang.googlepages.com/ChineseIME.html
" ---------------------------------------------------------------
"  Tips:
"  (1) i_<C-^> can be mapped to pick up the default right away:
"      im  <silent><C-^>  <C-X><C-U><C-U><C-P><C-N>
"  (2) The data file can also include English as the key
"  (3) The sequence of data file can be adjusted based on frequency
"  (4) Reference #5 may be used to automatically open the popup menu
