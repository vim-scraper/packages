" Vim plugin for automatically saving backup versions in rcs
" whenever a file is saved.
"
" What's RCS? See http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html
"
" Be careful if you really use RCS as your production file control, it
" will add versions like crazy.
"
" If you're using Microsoft Windows, then the rcs programs are available by
" installing WinCVS (http://www.wincvs.org/), and putting the wincvs directory
" in your path.
"
" rcs-menu.vim by Jeff Lanzarotta is handy to have along with this (vimscript #41).
"
" To Do: add version/diff viewing tools like savevers.vim
"
" Changes:
" 1.3 	option to select the rcs directory,
" 		and better comments thanks to Juan Frias
"
